# Airline-Data-Analysis-With-Qlik

## Project overview:
This project is about using Qlik tools to analyze synthetic airline data. The dataset includes information like passenger details, airport names, continent and country names, and dates. The main challenge is to understand trends in the number of passengers. Reading through tables full of names and locations is hard, but business analytics tools like Qlik make it easier. With Qlik, we can turn the data into clear and simple visualizations. These visualizations help us see patterns and trends quickly, making it much easier to understand the data compared to looking at raw tables. This way, we can make better decisions based on the insights we get from the data
